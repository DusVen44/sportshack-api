- Sportshack Supplement Depot -
This application is for a local Lafayette, LA brick and mortar business. Sportshack
sells high-quality supplements for anyone who wants to improve their health and performance.
They also offer smoothies and wraps made fresh in the store.

- Built with Node -
Express - PostreSQL - Mocha - Chai

- Why -
The original design of the website was cluttered, redundant, and difficult to navigate.
It was created using Shopify, but the online store wasn't functional. I offered to recreate
the site from scratch with the hopes of creating more business for the owner. Users can see 
the address, phone number, and hours of operation immediately upon visiting the site. They 
can view the smoothie menu along with the nutrition facts for each size. Also, users can 
see the sandwhich/wrap options. This new design is much easier to use, and the most important
aspects of the business are featured.
